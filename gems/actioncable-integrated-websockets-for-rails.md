# Action Cable - Integrated websockets for Rails

Today I found an interesting gem that we might be able to implement for future notification and stuff

The gem is call actioncable, in short it is basically a gem that integrates websockets with Rails.

It built on top of `faye-websocket` and `celluloid`.

The only downside is that the only Database that it support right now is Redis only.
