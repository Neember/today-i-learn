# Today I Learn
Today-I-Learn (TIL) is inspired by Thoughbot, TIL is a repository for everyone to share what we have learn today.

Commits in this repository are the things we learn - small tips. Every coder in Futureworkz are automatically subscripted to this repository and will receive an email whenever there is a new commit.

## How to commit

If you are a member of Futureworkz, you should have push access to this repository.

To commit, simply put your TIL in a markdown in the relevant folder eg. `rails/my-learning-for-today.md`

Your commit message should be in this format: `TIL <folder>: <TIL Subject>`.
You should also add the content of your TIL into the description of the commit message so that in the email sent out, everyone can just read the TIL instead of going to Github to read the commit.

For example, a Rails TIL for new timestamps in Rails 5 should be `TIL rails: New Timestamps in Rails 5`. This TIL should also be placed in rails folder.
