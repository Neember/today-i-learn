# ActionCable Rails 5

As Rails5 is into beta3 right now, things are getting stabilize.

This is a good time to introduce to Rails5 ActionCable as more and more project requires a chat system or a real time discussion board.

This is a place that can start to understand ActionCable [http://slides.com/windy/actioncable-in-rails5#/](actioncable in rails 5 with sample code)

This is something that ActionCable is able to achieve! [http://jargon.io/joeyschoblaska/rails-5-chess-with-action-cable-websockets](Build a chess using Rails5 ActionCable)
