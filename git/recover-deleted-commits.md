# Recover your deleted/lost git commits

Sometimes we execute destructive git actions too fast and lost some of our commits.

However, if you use `git reflog` immediately after you lost your commits, you can get back your lost commits.

Basically, `git reflog` shows you a list of your commit action history and from there, you can reset or cherry-pick back the lost commits.
