# Leader Maps Are Lame

Instead of using leader mapping, we can map our own custom keyboard shortcuts through operators ie. c-(your own key).

For example, we can use c-h as "change hash from ruby 1.9 to ruby 2.0" to create a custom shortcut to change the hash from ruby 1.9 style to ruby 2.0 style.
